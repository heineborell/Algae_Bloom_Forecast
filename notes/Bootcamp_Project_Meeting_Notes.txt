train on this data, build model, compare to another area with similar parameters but not as much info
for measurements (train on one state and test model on another state).

For now work with the data we have (NOAA).

It'll be cool to compare fresh vs salt water

Assignment 1
performance indicators: 
	Predicting/Forecasting an algae bloom accurately, 
	model built on the more reliable measurements (maybe add weights to features based on reliability),
	predicting on location as well?,
        severity in bloom (how long) 

stakeholders:
	NOAA
	People that consume from a water source suceptible to algae blooms
	State Tourism Board
	Fish and Wildlife Department
what the problem is: people are getting sick from algae blooms

to do: put the website for the data on the slack channel
	start a github so that everyone can have a fork
	put the meeting notes on the github
	complete assignment 1 (check out the KPI's of past projects, on google doc)

Directions we want to try to move in:
Taking a closer look at the nans in our data (so far the nan treatment is ok).
-Is there a pattern (seasonality) in the nans?
-Check the other info available that come with the nans

Organize the data by latitute and longtitude instead of by state/regions:
-Looking for blooms along certain latitudes (may imply temp differences)
-Check on ditribution of the type of algae/blooms (state/region/lat-long)


Frequency of the blooms:
-For a baseline we can see if there are seasonal patterns and can just use the average over the years
-Since we're looking at timeseries data can look at seasonality
-Consider the 'time resolution' of the data'
-Look at the duration of the blooms
-Look at frequency of the measurements in the same location



Group Tasks:
We might want to use jupytext if we are going to be doing pull requests.
Jupytext creates py files where it is easy to see diff changes in github.

Looking at spatial concentrations of blooms is easy in tableau. Nathan is going to look into this.

As a group we decided to just work with forks for now and leave branches alone.

Next meeting same time in two weeks with the mentor
Thursday 8:30pm EDT
Not sure if this is set in stone. In the future 9:00pm is probably better for some members,
we'll have to decide.

To Do:
Individually do some EDA and compare notes sometime next week

Deniz made a really good map gif that'd be good for the final slides.
(maybe we want to focus on Venice and Saratosa?)

Deniz scatter matrix and pairplots shows that there isn't a strong linear relationship.

Korean academic paper used linear regression, neural networks, random forest, and sklearn gbm.

The bimodality of the blooms per year suggests we should look closely at temperature

to do:
Need to read the Korean paper

Put link to the Korean paper on the READme

Investigate the nans

Continue working on EDA for the meeting next week with the advisor.

Check out the support documents for the data, might find a explanation for the Mississippi event.

investiage the correlation between cell and sample depth

investigate the correlation between latittude and cell count?

investigate the correlation between temp, salinity and the cellcount

filter out 'not observed' category

Nathan found that the nan's appear to be a random draw, and have no special correlation with the
other features. Appears to take a random 50% cut of the data. 
Might be a good idea to do the cut manually to see if the plot is the same.

Deniz found that our data doesn't seem to have seasonality between 2010 and 2023 (will look more into it)
and so our data is most likely a trend time series

Seasonality seems to be lacking so we're going to do exponential smoothing around a trending type 
time series.

Arima (neural networks) are also good.
