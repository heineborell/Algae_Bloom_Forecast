train on this data, build model, compare to another area with similar parameters but not as much info
for measurements (train on one state and test model on another state).

For now work with the data we have (NOAA).

It'll be cool to compare fresh vs salt water

Assignment 1
performance indicators: 
	Predicting/Forecasting an algae bloom accurately, 
	model built on the more reliable measurements (maybe add weights to features based on reliability),
	predicting on location as well?,
        severity in bloom (how long) 

stakeholders:
	NOAA
	People that consume from a water source suceptible to algae blooms
	State Tourism Board
	Fish and Wildlife Department
what the problem is: people are getting sick from algae blooms

to do: put the website for the data on the slack channel
	start a github so that everyone can have a fork
	put the meeting notes on the github
	complete assignment 1 (check out the KPI's of past projects, on google doc)
